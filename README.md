//IMPORTANT

In this project we used React in the frontend and python for the backend. Someother things we used was a read API and a database using Django and we also play with a little bit of SQLLite3 as well. It was a really difficult process but in the end the final product turned out amazing! Again, thank you Sonnie for making this project into a reality and mentoring m throughout the process. 

Again I hope you guys enjoy the project we worked hard on!
